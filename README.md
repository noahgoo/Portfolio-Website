The Skills page should be aligned with Mint to Lavender gradient.
The About page should be aligned with Green to Aqua gradient.
The Contact page should be aligned with Peach to Light Orange gradient.

**Home**

The homepage should capture attention but not be too flashy. There is a simple navigation bar on the top that leads to each page.
There should be a section for text explaining a bit of me and my goals. Below should be a row of 4 mini components that each show a snapshot to a project I've done. Clicking on a component takes you to that project page.

**Projects**

Similar to the Home page, there should be a grid with rows of 4 components that show snapshots to projects I've done. They might include an image, a title, and short description. Clicking on a componenet will take you to the page for that project.

**Skills**

This page shows colorful circles that fit the theme that slowly bounce around on the page. Each circle will have a skill on it. These skills and circles
can be added to this page in a section of the code.

**About**

This page will show a picture of me and include my bio. More will be added later.

**Contact**

This simple page will have contact information such as my email, linkedin, etc.

**Future Enhancements**

Blog section for technical writing
Interactive project demos
Dark/light mode toggle
Backend integration for contact form

This README is part of my summer 2025 preparation for BYU Computer Engineering Junior Core.
